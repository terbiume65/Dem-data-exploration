# Brief Preliminary EDA of Human Development Related Data
### Introduction
This was sort of a warm-up exercise before the main work of my internship. I briefly assembled and explored some of the related datasets 
that may be of interest to the Human Development Report Office. The work is short and rough. All datasets are open data and not sensitive.
Therefore, it does not violate the NDA.
